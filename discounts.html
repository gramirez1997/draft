			<h2>Adoption Is Easy </h2>
			<p>Pet adoption seems overwhelming at first but is easy. The first step is finding an adoption center near you. Once you locate a center you like, no appointment is needed. You can simply walk right in. In all centers you can sit/walk with the pet you are interested in so you can both get familiar with each other. Once you have found a pet just let a staff member know. They will direct you to fill out some paperwork with basic questions about you that mostly focus on your home. <br> TIP! Most centers have adoption days or promotions that cut the adoption fee in half, just ask, or call to find out!</p>
