    	<h1>Stray Animals in San Antonio</h1>
    	<p>As someone who was born and raised in San Antonio I have noticed a overwhelming amount of stray animals wondering the streets. According to the asilomar reports from the <cite>Animal Care Services of San Antonio </cite> in 2023 there was a reported <a href="https://www.sanantonio.gov/Portals/0/Files/AnimalCare/Asilomar/FY2023/FY2023%20ACS%20Asilomar%20NEW%202018.pdf?ver=2023-10-23-144650-243">  2,594</a> healthy cats and dogs that were euthenized due to over capacity in the shelter. That is over a 100% increse from 2022 where there was a reported <a href="https://www.sanantonio.gov/Portals/0/Files/AnimalCare/Asilomar/FY2022/ACS%20Asilomar%20FY22.pdf?ver=2022-10-12-114417-113"> 1,055</a> euthenized cats and dogs. As a advid animal lover this breaks my heart. As a community we need to come together and do better.   </p>

      <h2>Solving The Problem</h2>
      <p>Lowering euthanization rates and keeping animals off the streets of San Antonio does not have one simple solution.</p>
      <h2>Pet Adoption</h2>
      <p>An increase in pet adoptions will create space for more aniamls and gives them a chance to find forever homes.</p>
      <h2>Neutering</h2>
      <p>There is many misconceptions that nutering animals is unethical, however this is incorrect. Neutering animals is a key solution in lowering euthanization rates due to less animals being breed.</p>
	  <h2>Donations</h2>
	  <p>Donations are greatly appreciated at all animal shelters. They accept all kinds of donations even pet supplies and unwanted blankets.</p>
