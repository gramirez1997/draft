						<p>Our Featured Pet is a terrier pix mixed name Mama! She was returned to Animal care services twice, Sadly this last return would have been the end of the road for her. Fortunately she was rescued and placed into a foster home. However this is a temporary home and is still looking for a forever home! Mama is very sweet and loving. She would do best in a home with no other pets. She is very energetic and would be great match to someone who loves to go on hikes and trails. Contact me for more infromation! </p>
